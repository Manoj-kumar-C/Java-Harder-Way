# Core Concepts of Servlets

## 1. Servlet Basics
- **Definition**: Servlets are Java classes that handle HTTP requests and generate responses. They are part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) specification.
- **Lifecycle**: Understanding the lifecycle of a servlet, which includes initialization (`init()`), request handling (`service()`), and destruction (`destroy()`).

## 2. Servlet Interface
- **`HttpServlet` Class**: Most servlets extend `HttpServlet`, which simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Request and Response Objects**: Servlets use `HttpServletRequest` to receive client requests and `HttpServletResponse` to send responses.

## 3. Request Handling
- **HTTP Methods**: Handling different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) through methods like `doGet()`, `doPost()`, `doPut()`, and `doDelete()`.
- **Request Parameters**: Extracting parameters from the request using methods like `getParameter()`.

## 4. Response Generation
- **Generating Output**: Sending data back to the client using `PrintWriter` or `ServletOutputStream` to write content to the response.
- **Content Types**: Setting the content type of the response using `setContentType()`.

## 5. Session Management
- **HttpSession**: Managing user sessions using the `HttpSession` interface to store user-specific data across multiple requests.
- **Session Tracking**: Techniques for session tracking, including cookies, URL rewriting, and hidden form fields.

## 6. Servlet Configuration
- **Deployment Descriptor (web.xml)**: Configuring servlets using the `web.xml` file to define servlet parameters, mappings, and other configurations.
- **Annotations**: Using annotations like `@WebServlet` for configuration in place of `web.xml`.

## 7. Servlet Context
- **ServletContext**: Sharing data between servlets in the same application using the `ServletContext` object.
- **Context Parameters**: Setting and retrieving context-wide parameters.

## 8. Error Handling
- **Error Pages**: Configuring custom error pages in `web.xml` to handle different HTTP errors and exceptions.
- **Exception Handling**: Managing exceptions within servlets using `try-catch` blocks and exception handling mechanisms.

## 9. Request Dispatching
- **RequestDispatcher**: Forwarding or including content from another servlet or JSP using `RequestDispatcher` to manage request flow within the application.

## 10. Filters and Listeners
- **Filters**: Using filters to preprocess or postprocess requests and responses, such as for logging, authentication, or modifying request data.
- **Listeners**: Implementing listeners to monitor and respond to events like session creation/destruction, context initialization, etc.

## 11. Concurrency and Synchronization
- **Thread Safety**: Understanding how servlets handle multiple simultaneous requests and ensuring that servlets are thread-safe.

## 12. Integration with JSP
- **JSP and Servlets**: Understanding the relationship between JSP (JavaServer Pages) and servlets, including how JSPs are compiled into servlets.

## 13. Advanced Topics
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Using asynchronous servlets to handle long-running tasks without blocking the request thread.
- **RESTful Services**: Implementing RESTful web services using servlets or frameworks like JAX-RS.
